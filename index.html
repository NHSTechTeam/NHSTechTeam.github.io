                            <p>Game Dev is something that the Tech Team has been working on for a long time, and have slowly getting more and more pieces together. It has been slowly developed since early 2012, and has been expanded into a lot more. It currently is in the process of planning and programming, and a lot of work has been done on the project in recent months.</p>
                            <p>Game Dev is such a large project because it encompases almost all of the interests that people have in the club. Programming for the code. Graphics and 3-D design for the characters. Audio for the sounds. It grabs a little piece of everything, which is exactly how it is in the real world when making a game. It is a learning experience as well, as most of the people working on the project has never worked on the piece that they are working on.<p>
							<p>In order to make the game function, there needs to be a chosen programming language. Because different people in the club know different languages, we are making TWO version of the same game, in different languages, and then when it is done, we will decide as a team which is the best one to release for people to play.
							<p>A prototype should be available for download and play in the coming weeks. If you are interested in testing it, or just playing it, stay tuned for more information on what happens next!</p>

                            <p>Purpose
								<br><br>The Tech Team Policy is the core document the team follows for its operations. It outlines the expectations and functions of the team and its members. All members are expected to have read and accepted these terms upon gaining membership, and are expected to adhere to these terms for the length of their membership.
								<br><br>Revision 1.011a [2012-05-30] notes
								<br><br>The first actual synthesis of the list of bullet points found on Google Documents. Not many changes were made in the crossover, save for some input from Doug Pierce and Shawn Chowdhury. 
								<br><br>Much of the data found there was excised to be put into the new Tech Team Code, which will get into the details about various functions of the team.
								<br><br>Revision 1.011b [2012-05-30] notes
								<br><br>Some crediting issues, missing words, mechanical issues, etc., were fixed by Alex W. and Shawn C.
								<br><br>Revision 1.02 [2012-06-06] notes
								<br><br>Changes in typesetting and clarification of some points in the text were made by Shawn C.
								<br><br>Revision 2.00 [2014-04-25] notes
								<br><br>Complete overhaul of all sections of the document to ensure validity with the current Team hierarchy and managerial state were performed by Luke G. 
								<br><br>Revision 2.01 [2014-05-06] notes
								<br><br>Changes to the Elected Positions, some typo correction and an edit to the binding sheet to save paper.
								<br><br>THE CONTENTS OF THIS DOCUMENT ARE EFFECTIVE UPON RATIFICATION AND MUST BE ACCEPTED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE NEWTOWN HIGH SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY TEAM. FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS DOCUMENT MAY ENTAIL STRIKING, SUSPENSION, OR EXPULSION FROM THE TEAM.
								<br><br>Extraneous Information
								<br><br>The majority of this policy is set in twelve-point Times New Roman. The NTV logo is set in Chlorinut (this font should not be used in any other circumstances) with Silkscreen for the motto text. Thanks to Neil Davis, Justin Timmons, Doug Pierce, Alex Woloszynski, Kyle Johnsen, Alan Michael (Miguel) Diaz, Charles Lundblad, Laura Newberry, Grant Kurtz, Shane Price, Shawn Chowdhury, and all previous alumni for their contributions to the prior policies.
								<br><br>Preamble
								<br><br>The Newtown High School Technology Team, in order to preserve order and promote a more productive effective team, do establish this Policy for the current and future Newtown High School Technology Team.
								<br><br>The Technology [Tech] Team, from here on referred to as the ‘Team’, exists to provide a social medium for the exchange of knowledge among students with a preexisting understanding and a never-ending curiosity regarding technology of all kinds, as well as a learning environment to increase the Team’s ability as a whole.
								<br><br>Article I – Membership Outline
								<br><br>Membership in the Tech Team is primarily earned through contribution and display of ability. Candidates for membership are required to work with, and contribute to, the Team, in order to be eligible for membership. A candidate will be immediately expected to begin working at becoming a member when the candidate [referred to as Probationary Members, Probationaries, or Probies] displays their continued desire to become a part of the Tech Team.
								<br><br>Membership is the official association of the Team with a member. A member will have access to B253, the resources of the Tech Team as designated by their access level, and the ability to vote upon various team decisions (including, but not limited to, the induction of new members). Failed attempt at membership do not immediately preclude Probationaries from subsequent attempts, except in extenuating circumstances as defined by the current President and Vice President. 
								<br><br>Section II – Membership Requirements
								<br><br>It is the duty of all existing members of the Team to evaluate and observe Probationaries in certain areas: behavior, participation, work ethic, general participation, and other qualities that members of the team would require. Once a Probationary becomes a Member, these expectations are not dropped. In order to remain a member of the team, once must not only continue contributing the team on the order of attending at least one meeting a week (unless an excuse is submitted to the sitting Secretary prior to the meeting), and adhere to all school rules outlined in the Student Handbook. This includes, but is not limited to, unexcused absences or tardiness in school, bullying of other students and/or staff, harassment in any form of other students and/or staff, theft, vandalism, and wearing inappropriate clothing. 
								<br><br>Section III – Member Expectations
								<br><br>All members must adhere to standards of the Tech Team in the following: professional standards of behavior and participation of events (such as Board of Education meetings, Team meetings, school-sanctioned sports events, and staff related services), upholding personal responsibilities and Team-wide responsibilities, continuous activity within the Team, and anything defined by the sitting President or Vice President as an expectation.
								<br><br>Subsection I – Professional Behavior and Standards
								<br><br>Members are expected to operate at a competent level of understanding, both in a technical and social sense. In addition to operating at a high-level, all parties must interact with one another in a respectful manner. Those in elected and appointed seats are designated as official delegates and representatives, however, all members of the Team represent the Team whenever working with external entities. Horseplay, conflict, and public displays of affection are grounds for a strike, especially when observed by external entities.
								<br><br>Article II – Responsibilities
								<br><br>Section I – General Responsibilities
								<br><br>Members of the Team will be expected to take responsibility for any of their own actions, including, but not limited to, directions given to Probationary Members, activity in productions, attendance to meetings, and other Team tasks they take part in. Activity in all aspects of the Technology Team must be evident: members are expected to attend both meetings a week, and required to attend at least one. Failure to do so will result in a strike unless proper excuse is presented to the sitting Secretary prior to the meeting. Members are required to either attend, or edit, at least one event a month. If this is not possible, Members are expected to be working on Personal Projects, progress on which is to be shown at meetings. 
								<br><br>Section II – Elected Positions
								<br><br>Elected Positions are President, Vice President, Treasurer, Equipment Manager, Secretary, Broadcast Director, Software Director, and Project Manager. Elections will occur no more than two months prior to the end of the school year, and any position that is not filled in the Election will be appointed within the first month of the following school year. It is the responsibility of the whole Team (excluding Probationary Members) to vote on those who will fill these roles yearly. It is also the responsibility of those not in an official position to work with those who are, and follow their decisions. Should a decision be questioned, a vote may be proposed, and majority ruling within the Team will enable it to be overturned.
								<br><br>Article III – Security and Enforcement
								<br><br>Section I – Safety
								<br><br>All members of the Team, including Probationary Members, represent the Team when operating at any school event or using the rooms. Physical altercations between Team Members will experience a no-tolerance policy, and successful verification of events will result in suspension of one or both parties from the Team for a period of no less than two weeks. The extent of the punishment will be determined by the sitting President or Vice President. Serious threats, especially those made in jest without obvious lack of intent, are extremely unprofessional and grounds for strikes. Haphazard equipment handling deployment can lead to damage of equipment and harm to people, thus is also grounds for a Member to be stricken. 
								<br><br>Section II – Strike System
								<br><br>Any Member can bring up a strike against another Member. In the case of a rule violation by a Probationary Member, the prosecution may propose the punishment to the sitting President or Vice President. Strikes may be brought up based on violation of Team Policy, violation of School Rules, or if they believe it would be in the Team’s best interest. The Team may vote once both parties have made their case, however, the President may not: he or she resides as an impartial judge to moderate discussion and determine appropriate punishment in addition to the Strike. 
								<br><br>Section III – Policy Content and Revision
								<br><br>This document may only be revised in the case that the supermajority, two thirds of the Members present at the meeting when it is proposed, vote to do so. Minor changes may be voted on by the current Position holders, while major changes must be voted on by the entire team. Major changes would include, but are not limited to, redefinition of positions, redefinition of how Membership is attained, redefinition of how a Position is attained, redaction or addition to the current placed system, etc. Minor changes would include, but are not limited to, spell corrections, formatting corrections, etc. All Members who have previously agreed to the Terms also agree to any future additions so long as they remain a Member of the Team.

                            <p>The job of the Vice President is fairly self explanatory. The vice president's job is to be able to perform all the roles the president may in his/her absence. While the President deals often with managing with outside contacts, the Vice president mostly manages internally, making sure every member is doing their job and that there is a sense of quality control. Whatever information the president so does the vice president. As vice president is next in line he needs to be as able as the president to run meetings and the club should he be unavailable. Most of the work consists of making sure that the club is up to a standard and to make sure the club is moving in the right direction.</p>
							<p>Devin Matte is the current president. He has a passion for business, management and marketing. He considers himself a leader and a bit of a workaholic. He has found that his skill are heavily in video production and all things video and photography. His skills are in video but he is working on building his knowledge of audio and broadcasting.</p>
